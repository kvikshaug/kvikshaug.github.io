        I am a senior software engineer located in Copenhagen, Denmark. I currently work on <a href="https://caffeine.dd-decaf.eu">Caffeine</a>, a unique tool which brings computer-aided design into the realm of metabolic engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, I was employed by the <a href="https://www.dnt.no/">Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT)</a>, and I was a core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/Turistforeningen">a number of their open source projects</a>. I love open source and also personally run a handful of small hobby projects. Most of these are published on <a href="https://gitlab.com/kvikshaug">gitlab</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kvikshaug">github</a>, and once in a while I will ask or answer a question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/302484/kvikshaug">stack overflow</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other open source projects I have contributed to include <a href="https://memote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">memote</a>, a genome-scale metabolic model test suite published in 2019 in <a href="https://www.nature.com/nbt/">Nature Biotechnology</a>. A presentation of my humble career in academia is available on <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2805-310X">ORCID</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I'm not actively looking for new work at the moment, I can be open to discuss new business opportunities. Read my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/story/kvikshaug">story</a> or contact me on <a href="mailto:ali@kvikshaug.no">ali@kvikshaug.no</a>.

        I use <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> on a daily basis to implement a <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a>-inspired productivity methodology, in order to organize and keep track of everything from mundane household chores to major life goals. This lets me prioritize and engage with the appropriate topics or issues at any time, without losing perspective and the capacity to integrate and adapt to new information. This has profoundly improved my personal productivity and I heartily recommend both the methodology, and <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> as a fitting implementation tool.

        Some of my life-long passions include <a href="https://vimeo.com/53413403">snowboarding</a>, splitboarding, cross-country skiing and <a href="https://ut.no/">mountain hiking</a>. Additionally, I've loved playing <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/kvikshaug">video games</a> since I was 5 years old, and at this point, I don't think I will ever outgrow them.
