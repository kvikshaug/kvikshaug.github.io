        I am a senior software engineer located in Copenhagen, Denmark. I currently work on <a href="https://caffeine.dd-decaf.eu">Caffeine</a>, a unique tool which brings computer-aided design into the realm of metabolic engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love open source and have in the past been a core contributor to technological solutions in the <a href="https://github.com/Turistforeningen">Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT)</a>. Personally, I run a handful of small hobby projects. Most of these are published on <a href="https://gitlab.com/kvikshaug">gitlab</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kvikshaug">github</a>, and once in a while I will ask or answer a question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/302484/kvikshaug">stack overflow</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other open projects I have contributed to include <a href="https://memote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">memote</a>, a genome-scale metabolic model test suite published in 2019 in <a href="https://www.nature.com/nbt/">Nature Biotechnology</a>. A presentation of my humble career in academia is available on <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2805-310X">ORCID</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although I'm not actively looking for new work at the moment, I can be open to discuss new business opportunities. Read my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/story/kvikshaug">story</a> or contact me on <a href="mailto:ali@kvikshaug.no">ali@kvikshaug.no</a>.

        I consider myself hedonistic, in that I find meaning in life through recreation. That is not to say that I am lazy or irresponsible; I take pride in how well I manage my daily life and career. I actively use Trello to implement a <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a>-inspired methodology, which helps me organize everything from mundane household chores to major life goals. However, at the end of the day, those chores are all a necessary means to an end, which is purely about living an enjoyable and fulfilling life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Different people will of course value recreational activities differently. Some of my own life-long passions include <a href="https://vimeo.com/53413403">snowboarding</a>, splitboarding, cross-country skiing and <a href="https://ut.no/">mountain hiking</a>. Additionally, I've loved playing <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/kvikshaug">video games</a> since I was 5 years old, and at this point, I don't think I will ever outgrow them.
